# Zomato-Case-Study
In this project we will try to analyze a dataset with different restaurants and cuisines using Python.

##Problem Statements
1)Plot the bar graph of number of restaurants present in Delhi NCR vs Rest of India.
2) Find the cuisines which are not present in restaurant of Delhi NCR but present in rest of India.
3) Find the top 10 cuisines served by maximum number of restaurants in Delhi NCR and rest of India.
4)Write a short detailed analysis of how cuisine served is different from Delhi NCR to Rest of India. Plot the suitable graph to explain your inference.
5)Compare the price range for restaurants that have table booking vs that have online booking. Plot suitable graphs

##Note:
The dataset is highly skewed toward the cities included in Delhi-NCR. So, we will summarise all the
other cities in Rest of India while those in New Delhi, Ghaziabad, Noida, Gurgaon, Faridabad to
Delhi-NCR. Doing this would make our analysis turn toward Delhi-NCR v Rest of India.
